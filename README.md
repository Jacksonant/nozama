# Nozama - E-commerce Store

I refer to Amazon, but only refer halfway and got occupied for features logics(plus tired)

## Tech Choices & Why
- NextJs: Ecommerce needs SEO, so vanilla ReactJS might not be a good choice (though this is a frontend test)
- shadcnUI: Helps me to build components faster(with messy inline tailwind CSS)
- Zustand: Less boilerplate as a store for me personally
- JSON data from MakupAPI - Has a lot of products compared to other free ecommerce api.
                          - Why not fetch from this API? It is super duper slow and has no pagination. So I save the JSON data locally.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install stuff
yarn install

# Run it
yarn dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## What I Built

- Product browsing with infinite scroll
- Filters (category, brand, price range)
- Search with product suggestions
- Product detail pages
- Shopping cart
- Dark/light theme toggle

## Assumptions & Trade-offs

**Assumptions:**
- Images are optimized (thumbnails etc)
- Products are always available
- Prices are valid (even some products here are 0 cost)

**Trade-offs:**
- Used localStorage for everything instead of a real database
- Cart doesn't sync across devices
- Mobile view is very ugly (no time to adjust it)

## What I'd Do With More Time

- **Features**: 
  - User accounts and wishlists in local storage
  - Filters history
- **Polish**: 
  - Better loading states
  - Skeleton screens everywhere
  - Animations and transitions
  - Accessibility audit and fixes
  - Mobile view
  - Some components ui such as Product Card

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests
yarn test:watch
```

**What's tested:**
- Product card rendering (Although this is cheating a bit here)
- Cart operations (add, remove, update)
- Filter logic
- Basic component rendering

I focused on testing the cart logic since that's the most critical part. The component tests are pretty basic - just making sure things render without exploding. With more time, I'd add tests for the search, filters, and user flows like "add to cart → checkout".

## Notes

AI generated components:
1. Reviews
2. Hero sections
3. Prodcut specs section

AI asisting styling components:
1. Basically all components after I arrange their positions

AI asisting logics:
1. getImageUrl and sanitize utils
Why? Fix regnex problem

## Timeline
Tech stack selection: ~ 1 hour (I migrate my work from React to Next js)
Building components: ~16 hours (imagine every components from scratch)
Logics hooks, utils, component functions: ~ 8 hours
Mobile view: ~ 4 hours (Still looking ugly)
Testing: ~ 3 hours (Has to give up some test due to time constraint)
Deployment: ~ 1 hour (Jest is causing me issue)

Total: ~ Roughly 3 days
